# Restaurant Reviews Project 
This is the final project for the Udacity Front-End web developer course. The objective of this project was to make a modern, mobile-ready application using the starter code [here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git)
## Getting Started
To run this program do this:
`./serveit.py 8000`

This starter code was enhanced with the following features:
1. *Responsive Web Design* I used media queries to set a breakpoint at `400px` in the `index.html` file to allow reading in a specialized CSS file optimized for smaller screens (`style_scree_small.css`). I introduced relative units into the sizing and also a flexbox. 

2. *Accessibility* I added `tabindex` and `labels` to make sure that app would be more user friendly for screen readers. I also made sure that all images had `alt` text. 

3. I added a service working script in `sw.js` in order to cache requests to the sites assets in case the user is offline. 

Enjoy!
